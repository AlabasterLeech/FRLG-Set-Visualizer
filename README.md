This project will hopefully eventually be a web app which can be used to make neat/cute little visualizations of the sets used in competitive Pokemon based on the status screen from Fire Red and Leaf Green.

This repository contains all of my code, but it does not contain all of the sprites and images which are used in the project for the sake of space.

This is entirely a personal project and was mostly embarked on as a way for me to jump into learning javascript and to actually get experience using both git and github. As a result, I've paid very little care to the factoring of my code and this whole project is a little bit of a mess. Additionally, there's little to no error handling. Please do not judge me too harshly for that. The result of all this is that it is unlikely that this project will be publicly useable for the foreseeable future. I may take on refactoring and launching this as a future project, but for now this remains a personal project and exploration.

At any rate, thank you for showing interest in this project and/or me. Hopefully, at the time you are reading this there are other things on my github profile which leave you with a more substantial positive impression of me.

The image processing portion of the code uses/will use JIMP (https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp).


Item sprites are from Serebii.  
Gen 1-3 Sprites are ripped directly from Pokemon FireRed and Pokemon Emerald.  
Gen 4 and Gen 5 sprites are from The DS-style 64x64 Pokémon Sprite Resource (https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=267728)  
Gen 6 and mega sprites are from Gen VI: DS-Style 64x64 Pokemon Sprite Resource (https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=314422)  
Gen 7 and 8 sprites, including Gigantamax are from DS-style Gen VII and Beyond Pokémon Sprite Repository in 64x64 (https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=368703)  

All other image resources were either ripped directly from Pokemon FireRed or made by yours truly in Krita.
