This project will hopefully eventually be a web app which can be used to make neat/cute little visualizations of the sets used in competitive Pokemon based on the status screen from Fire Red and Leaf Green.

This repository contains all of my code, but it does not contain all of the sprites and images which are used in the project for the sake of space.

The image processing portion of the code uses/will use JIMP (https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp).
